# `filesize`

A command-line utility to get the size of a file or directory, written in Go

## Getting Started

### Installation

Run the following command to install on UNIX-like operating systems:

```
curl -s https://installerfork-dbb5iadsuq-uc.a.run.app/!?type=script | bash
```

Looks like a sketchy URL, I know. It's the install script generator I'm hosting on Google Cloud. If you want to read through the install script before you run it, you can visit [https://installerfork-dbb5iadsuq-uc.a.run.app?type=script](https://installerfork-dbb5iadsuq-uc.a.run.app?type=script).


If you are using Windows, you'll need to download the executable for your operating system on the Releases page.
