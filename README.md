A command-line utility to get the size of a file or directory, written in Go

## Getting Started

### Installation

Run the following command to install on UNIX-like operating systems:

```
curl -s https://installfilesize.masonfrancis.net/! | sudo bash
```

You're right to be wary of running random bash scripts on your system, so if you want to read through the install script before you run it, you can see it at [https://installfilesize.masonfrancis.net/?type=script](https://installfilesize.masonfrancis.net/?type=script).


If you are using Windows, you'll need to download the executable for your operating system on the Releases page.
