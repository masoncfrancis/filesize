# `filesize`

A command-line utility to get the size of a file or directory, written in Go

## Getting Started

### Installation/Updating

Run the following command to install or update an existing installation on UNIX-like operating systems:

```
curl -s https://filesize.i.masonfrancis.net/! | sudo bash
```

You're right to be wary of running random bash scripts on your system, so if you want to read through the install script before you run it, you can see it at [https://filesize.i.masonfrancis.net/?type=script](https://filesize.i.masonfrancis.net/?type=script). It's not very long. 
Basically the script checks what OS and architecture you're using, downloads the appropriate binary, and installs it to `/usr/local/bin`.


If you are using Windows, you'll need to download the executable for your operating system on the Releases page. If you want it to always be accessible via the
command line or PowerShell, make sure to put it somewhere in your PATH variable (or add the directory it's in to your PATH variable).

### Usage

```
filesize [flag] <file or directory>
```

#### Flags

- `-l`: List sizes of files within the first level of the directory
- `-L`: List sizes of all subdirectories and their contents
- `-h`: Show detailed usage information
- `-v`: Show the version of the program
